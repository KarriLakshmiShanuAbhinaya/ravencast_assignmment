Cryptocurrency Trading Simulation
This is a Node.js application that fetches live cryptocurrency price data from a public API (CoinGecko) and simulates trades based on simple moving averages (SMAs). The application uses a circular buffer to efficiently manage recent price data and logs simulated buy/sell trades based on signals generated by SMA crossovers.

Features
API Integration: Fetch live price data from CoinGecko API every minute.
Trade Simulation:
Short-term and long-term SMA calculation (5 prices and 20 prices, respectively).
Buy/Sell signals based on SMA crossovers.
Logs simulated trades with timestamp, trade type (buy/sell), price, and quantity.
Efficient Data Handling: Utilizes a circular buffer to maintain a rolling list of recent prices for constant-time updates to the SMAs.
Logging: All trades are logged in a trades.log file.
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)
An internet connection to fetch live data from the API.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

Navigate to the project folder in your terminal:
cd path/to/project
Install the required dependencies:
npm install
To run the application:
node index.js
The application will start fetching live cryptocurrency prices every minute and will simulate trades based on SMA crossovers.

Design Decisions
SMA Calculation: The application calculates two SMAs—one short-term (last 5 prices) and one long-term (last 20 prices). Trades are simulated when the short-term SMA crosses above or below the long-term SMA (indicating a buy or sell signal, respectively).

Circular Buffer: We use a circular buffer (implemented with JavaScript's deque or array rotation) to store the most recent prices for efficient SMA calculation. This ensures that the application runs efficiently even with continuous price updates.

Logging: All trades are logged in a trades.log file with details like timestamp, price, trade type, and quantity. This helps in backtesting and tracking the performance of the simulation.

API Reference
The application uses the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices. For more information on the API, refer to the official documentation: CoinGecko API Documentation.

How to Use
Run the App: Start the application by running the command node index.js. The app will begin polling the CoinGecko API for real-time price data every minute.

View Trades: When a buy or sell signal is detected, the app will simulate a trade and log the trade details in the trades.log file.

Dependencies
node-fetch: For making HTTP requests to fetch cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API.
Assumptions
No Real Trades: This application is a simulation, meaning no real trades are executed. It's designed to showcase algorithmic trading logic.
SMA Calculation: SMA is calculated based on the last 5 and 20 prices respectively, which are stored in a circular buffer to ensure efficiency.
Future Improvements
Add More Indicators: Future versions of the app can include other technical indicators (e.g., exponential moving average, RSI) for more complex trading strategies.
Improve Error Handling: Add better error handling for API rate limits, timeouts, and network issues.
Real Trading: The app could be extended to connect with real trading platforms like Binance or Coinbase for executing actual trades.
